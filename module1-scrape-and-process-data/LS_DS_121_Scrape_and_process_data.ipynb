In the second case, all the dependencies come as separate packages (and most of the time from the OS itself). The dependency is being handled by the OS package manager itself.

CPU performance is plateauing, but GPUs provide a chance for continued hardware performance gains, if you can structure your programs to make good use of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nCUDA is a platform developed by Nvidia for GPGPU--general purpose computing with GPUs. It backs some of the most popular deep learning libraries, like Tensorflow and Pytorch, but has broader uses in data analysis, data science, and machine learning. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several ways that you can start taking advantage of CUDA in your Python programs. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor some common Python libraries, there are drop-in replacements that let you start running computations on the GPU while still using familiar APIs. For example, CuPy provides a NumPy-like API for interacting with multi-dimensional arrays. Similarly, cuDF is a recent project that mimics the pandas interface for dataframes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want more control over your use of CUDA APIs, you can use the PyCUDA library, which provides bindings for the CUDA API that you can call from your Python code. Compared with drop-in libraries, it gives you the ability to manually allocate memory on the GPU, and write custom CUDA functions (called kernels). However, its drawbacks include writing your CUDA code as large strings in Python, and compiling your CUDA code at runtime.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, for the best performance you can use the Python C/C++ extension interface, the approach taken by deep learning libraries like Pytorch. One of the strengths of Python is the ability to drop down into C/C++, and libraries like NumPy take advantage of this for increased speed. If you use Nvidia’s nvcc compiler for CUDA, you can use the same extension interface to write custom CUDA kernels, and then call them from your Python code.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis talk will explore each of these methods, provide examples to get started, and discuss in more detail the pros and cons of each approach. </div>\\n  \\n    <h2>\\n      <a id=\"presentation-184\"\\n         href=\"/2019/schedule/presentation/184/\">\\n        Dependency hell: a library author&#39;s guide\\n      </a>\\n    </h2>\\n    <p>\\n      <b>\\n        Yanhui Li, Brian Quinlan\\n        \\n      </b>\\n      \\n      <br>\\n      <b>\\n        Saturday\\n        11:30 a.m.&ndash;noon\\n        in\\n        Grand Ballroom B\\n      </b>\\n      \\n    </p>\\n    <div class=\"presentation-description\"\\n         >Python is known for its &quot;batteries included&quot; philosophy but no Python developer can live without the language&#39;s rich library ecosystem.

I’ll discuss the challenges we faced in developing a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective scientific computing platform in Python, with examples of novel solutions using Python’s extensive ecosystem of GIS, cloud computing and machine learning tools.\\r\\n</div>\\n  \\n    <h2>\\n      <a id=\"presentation-221\"\\n         href=\"/2019/schedule/presentation/221/\">\\n        Floats are Friends: making the most of IEEE754.00000000000000002\\n      </a>\\n    </h2>\\n    <p>\\n      <b>\\n        David Wolever\\n        \\n      </b>\\n      \\n      <br>\\n      <b>\\n        Saturday\\n        10:50 a.m.&ndash;11:20 a.m.\\n        in\\n        Grand Ballroom B\\n      </b>\\n      \\n    </p>\\n    <div class=\"presentation-description\"\\n         >Floating point numbers have been given a bad rap.

Set operations enable simpler and faster solutions for many tasks;\\r\\n1. Python&#39;s set classes are lessons in elegant, idiomatic API design;\\r\\n1. A set class is a suitable context for implementing operator overloading.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoolean logic and set theory are closely related. In practice, we will see cases where set operations provide simple and fast declarative solutions to programming problems that otherwise require complicated and slow procedural coding.\\r\\n\\r\\nPython&#39;s set built-ins and ABCs provide a rich and well designed API. We will consider their interfaces, and how they can inspire the creation of Pythonic APIs for your own classes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, we will discuss operator overloading — a technique that is not suitable everywhere, but certainly makes sense with sets. Taking a few operators as examples, we will study their implementation in a new `UintSet` class for integer elements. `UintSet` fully implements the `MutableSet` interface over a totally different internal representation based on a bit array instead of a hash table. Membership tests run in _O(1)_ time like the built-in sets (however, `UintSet` is currently pure Python, so YMMV). Using bit arrays allow core set operations like intersection and union to be implemented with fast bitwise operators, and provides compact storage for dense sets of integers.\\r\\n</div>\\n  \\n    <h2>\\n      <a id=\"presentation-197\"\\n         href=\"/2019/schedule/presentation/197/\">\\n        Statistical Profiling (and other fun with the sys module)\\n      </a>\\n    </h2>\\n    <p>\\n      <b>\\n        Emin Martinian\\n        \\n      </b>\\n      \\n      <br>\\n      <b>\\n        Saturday\\n        2:35 p.m.&ndash;3:05 p.m.\\n        in\\n        Atrium Ballroom AB\\n      </b>\\n      \\n    </p>\\n    <div class=\"presentation-description\"\\n         >Profiling involves computing a set of data about how often and how\\r\\nlong various parts of your program are executed.

Furthermore, it’s commonly accepted that inheritance actually breaks encapsulation. So, if inheritance has these issues, what alternative do we have?

However, its drawbacks include writing your CUDA code as large strings in Python, and compiling your CUDA code at runtime.\r\n",

This talk focuses on a few techniques (starting, shutting down, data flow, blocking, etc) that will maximize `multiprocessing`’s efficiency, while also helping you through the complex issues related to coordinating startup and _especially_ shutdown of your multiprocess app.\r\n",

We used Python to create the definitions, configuration files, and supplementary metadata for each of the weather radars we worked with.  We used a variety of custom tools to interface with existing systems and processes that would have been infeasible to work with otherwise.\r\n",

This talk will take a deep dive into the underlying data structure of pandas to explain why it performs the way it does under certain circumstances. It will explain why a MultiIndex DataFrame takes up less memory than it's simple counter part, why groupby should never be run on a non-MultiIndexed DataFrame, why the example documentation for the pandas apply function is an example of how not to use it, and how not taking the time to normalize data can affect performance.  \r\n",

Dependency management tools in the Python ecosystem lock dependencies to the latest version available, but what if the latest version available is not the best fit for your application?

How these recommendations look like? How are different observations like performance characteristics of machine learning libraries for a particular hardware gathered?</div>, <div class=\"presentation-description\">One of the reasons why programming in Python is very straightforward and simple is that we do not have to worry about the lifetime of our objects.

       " 'It’s 2019, and Moore’s Law is dead. CPU performance is plateauing, but GPUs provide a chance for continued hardware performance gains, if you can structure your programs to make good use of them. CUDA is a platform developed by Nvidia for GPGPU--general purpose computing with GPUs. It backs some of the most popular deep learning libraries, like Tensorflow and Pytorch, but has broader uses in data analysis, data science, and machine learning.  There are several ways that you can start taking advantage of CUDA in your Python programs.  For some common Python libraries, there are drop-in replacements that let you start running computations on the GPU while still using familiar APIs. For example, CuPy provides a NumPy-like API for interacting with multi-dimensional arrays. Similarly, cuDF is a recent project that mimics the pandas interface for dataframes. If you want more control over your use of CUDA APIs, you can use the PyCUDA library, which provides bindings for the CUDA API that you can call from your Python code. Compared with drop-in libraries, it gives you the ability to manually allocate memory on the GPU, and write custom CUDA functions (called kernels). However, its drawbacks include writing your CUDA code as large strings in Python, and compiling your CUDA code at runtime. Finally, for the best performance you can use the Python C/C++ extension interface, the approach taken by deep learning libraries like Pytorch. One of the strengths of Python is the ability to drop down into C/C++, and libraries like NumPy take advantage of this for increased speed. If you use Nvidia’s nvcc compiler for CUDA, you can use the same extension interface to write custom CUDA kernels, and then call them from your Python code. This talk will explore each of these methods, provide examples to get started, and discuss in more detail the pros and cons of each approach.',\n",

Or they would be, if they were true. Despite community perception, more than half of Python usage is on Windows, including web development, system administration, and data science, just like on Linux and Mac. And for the most part, Python works the same regardless of what operating system you happen to be using. Still, many library developers will unnecessarily exclude half of their potential audience by not even attempting to be compatible. This session will walk through the things to be aware of when creating cross-platform libraries. From simple things like using `pathlib` rather than `bytes`, through to all the ways you can get builds and tests running on Windows for free, by the end of this session you will have a checklist of easy tasks for your project that will really enable the whole Python world to benefit from your work.\",\n",

       " 'In the month of August 2018, Kerala, the southernmost state of India, received 250 % of normal rainfall, resulting in all of its 44 dams to be opened. Over 483 people died due to the flooding caused by the opening of dams and a million people were evacuated.  I started a website ([keralarescue.in][1]), written in Django. The main purpose of the site was effective collaboration and communication between authorities, volunteers and public. The site was open source from Day 0. About 1500 developers and volunteers onboard our slack group in a couple of days. Within a week, the community united to forge a critical piece of software that saved thousands of lives. The site initiated as a portal for refugees to request essential resources like food and water and for volunteers to see their needs, all sorted by geographical location. Additionally, we provided direct information for the government and became the official website later on. The Minimum Viable Product was delivered in fourteen hours. In the initial days, it was only used by the volunteers and Point of Contacts assigned by the government. Later, when the situation became critical, we started getting rescue requests from stranded refugees. The Github repo of the website went viral, and we started to receive feature requests rapidly. We received more than five hundred pull requests in the span of three weeks.  The story I want to present is about the community and technical aspects of keralarescue.in, how people from different backgrounds came together to build a critical piece of software that saved many lives.

       " \"Key takeaways: 1. Set operations enable simpler and faster solutions for many tasks;\\r\\n1. Python's set classes are lessons in elegant, idiomatic API design;\\r\\n1. A set class is a suitable context for implementing operator overloading. Boolean logic and set theory are closely related. In practice, we will see cases where set operations provide simple and fast declarative solutions to programming problems that otherwise require complicated and slow procedural coding. Python's set built-ins and ABCs provide a rich and well designed API. We will consider their interfaces, and how they can inspire the creation of Pythonic APIs for your own classes. Finally, we will discuss operator overloading — a technique that is not suitable everywhere, but certainly makes sense with sets. Taking a few operators as examples, we will study their implementation in a new `UintSet` class for integer elements. `UintSet` fully implements the `MutableSet` interface over a totally different internal representation based on a bit array instead of a hash table. Membership tests run in _O(1)_ time like the built-in sets (however, `UintSet` is currently pure Python, so YMMV). Using bit arrays allow core set operations like intersection and union to be implemented with fast bitwise operators, and provides compact storage for dense sets of integers.\",\n",

       " 'Inheritance is among the first concepts we learn when studying object-oriented programming. But inheritance comes with some unhappy strings attached. Inheritance, by its very nature, tends to bind a subclass to its superclass. This means that modifying the behavior of a superclass might alter the behavior of all its subclasses, sometimes in unanticipated ways. Furthermore, it’s commonly accepted that inheritance actually breaks encapsulation. So, if inheritance has these issues, what alternative do we have? More than two decades ago, The Gang of Four (Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides) suggested in their famous _Design Patterns_ book  that we should favor object composition over class inheritance. In this talk I will show some code examples in Python where inheritance goes astray and demonstrate how to correct them by using composition. My intention is not to demonize inheritance, but instead present how to use it wisely in order to improve the design of our object-oriented software so that it’s more flexible and easier to maintain.',\n",

That is, once it ceases to be necessary, a variable disappears from the memory \"magically\".

Nothing is further from reality: knowing how Python manages memory is fundamental in specific scenarios, and not knowing what is happening can have consequences as significant as unpleasant. For example, if our programs manage a large amount of data at the same time or launch multiple processes in parallel, this ceases to be a theoretical issue and becomes something that we, logical minds, also care. Although these concepts tend to be considered advanced and difficult to understand, we will see that this is not the case.

       "'In the month of August 2018, Kerala, the southernmost state of India, received 250 % of normal rainfall, resulting in all of its 44 dams to be opened. Over 483 people died due to the flooding caused by the opening of dams and a million people were evacuated.  I started a website ([keralarescue.in][1]), written in Django. The main purpose of the site was effective collaboration and communication between authorities, volunteers and public. The site was open source from Day 0. About 1500 developers and volunteers onboard our slack group in a couple of days. Within a week, the community united to forge a critical piece of software that saved thousands of lives. The site initiated as a portal for refugees to request essential resources like food and water and for volunteers to see their needs, all sorted by geographical location. Additionally, we provided direct information for the government and became the official website later on. The Minimum Viable Product was delivered in fourteen hours. In the initial days, it was only used by the volunteers and Point of Contacts assigned by the government. Later, when the situation became critical, we started getting rescue requests from stranded refugees. The Github repo of the website went viral, and we started to receive feature requests rapidly. We received more than five hundred pull requests in the span of three weeks.  The story I want to present is about the community and technical aspects of keralarescue.in, how people from different backgrounds came together to build a critical piece of software that saved many lives.
